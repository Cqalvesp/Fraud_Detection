Fraud Detection System
📌 Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for credit card fraud detection, built to handle highly imbalanced datasets. The goal is to identify fraudulent transactions with high accuracy while minimizing false positives.

The project demonstrates skills in data preprocessing, machine learning, deep learning with PyTorch, and handling imbalanced data, all while following best practices in data science project structure.

🚀 Features & Highlights

Data Preprocessing

Cleaned raw credit card transaction data (removed unnecessary columns, normalized features).

Applied train-test split with standardized scaling for balanced evaluation.

Handling Class Imbalance

Explored strategies like oversampling (Random Over Sampling & SMOTE).

Planned use of weighted binary cross-entropy loss to ensure fair learning across fraud/non-fraud classes.

Neural Network Model

Implemented a custom PyTorch neural network with multiple hidden layers.

Trained using Adam optimizer and Binary Cross-Entropy with Logits Loss.

Monitored loss curves to assess learning progress.

Experimentation

Adjusted model architectures (number of nodes & layers).

Evaluated impact of oversampling vs. weighted losses.

Tracked fraud vs. non-fraud class ratios throughout training.

Visualization

Plotted loss curves during training to diagnose underfitting/overfitting.

Prepared for future evaluation with metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.

📊 Next Steps

Incorporate SMOTE and compare against Random Oversampling.

Fine-tune the model architecture and hyperparameters.

Evaluate performance using precision/recall tradeoffs and confusion matrices.

Deploy the model via a Flask API, connected to a MySQL database for real-time predictions.

Build an interactive dashboard for fraud monitoring (targeting recruiter-friendly tech like Streamlit or Power BI).

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python (PyTorch, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, imbalanced-learn)

SQL (MySQL for future deployment)

Flask (planned for deployment)

Version Control: Git/GitHub
